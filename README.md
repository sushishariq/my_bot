## CUTE CRAWLER(my_bot)

This is my first attempt at building an end to end robot using ros2.

It does some basic operations:
    obstacle avoidance
    object detection and following
    differential drive


It uses some basic hardware such as:
    Pi
    RpLidar
    Diff drive motors
    Pi camera

There are a lot of possibilities ahead when you get comfortable with things.
